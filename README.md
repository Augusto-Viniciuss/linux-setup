# klaxalk's Linux environment

This repo contains settings of my Linux working environment: i3, tmux, vim

Everything is intended for and tested on **Ubuntu 16.04**.

To clone and install everything run following code. **BEWARE**, running this will **DELETE** your previous tmux and vim setup (.vim, .tmux.conf, .vimrc)!!:

```bash
cd /tmp
echo "mkdir -p ~/git
cd ~/git
sudo apt-get -y install git
git clone https://github.com/klaxalk/linux-setup.git
cd linux-setup
./install.sh" > run.sh && source run.sh
```
**Calling install.sh repeatedly** will not cause acumulation of gibrish in your .bashrc, so feel free to update your configuration by rerunning it.

# Toubleshooting

It is possible and probable that after you update using ```git pull```, something might not work anymore.
This usually happens due to new programs, plugins and dependencies that might not be satisfied anymore.
I strongly suggest to re-run **install.sh**, after each update.
